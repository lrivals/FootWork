# Model Performance Analysis: Feature Set Comparison

## Overall Performance Summary

### New Feature Set Performance
- Best performing models:
  - Logistic Regression (53.21% accuracy)
  - CatBoost (52.74% accuracy)
  - Extra Trees (52.74% accuracy)
- Average accuracy across all models: ~50%
- Most models show consistent performance between 49-53% accuracy
- Neural Network performed notably worse at 40.49%

### Previous Feature Set Performance
- Best performing models:
  - Logistic Regression & AdaBoost (52.48% accuracy)
  - CatBoost (52.25% accuracy)
  - Gradient Boosting (51.35% accuracy)

## Comparative Analysis

### Improvements
1. Overall Accuracy:
   - Slight improvement in top performers
   - Logistic Regression: 53.21% (new) vs 52.48% (old)
   - CatBoost: 52.74% (new) vs 52.25% (old)

2. Class-specific Improvements:
   - HomeWin predictions show better balance:
     - New features: 72-76% recall for top models
     - Old features: 80-81% recall but lower precision
   - More balanced performance across classes with new features

### Areas of Concern
1. Draw Prediction:
   - Remains challenging with both feature sets
   - New features: Most models achieve <10% recall
   - Previous features: Similar issues, though SVM reached 36% recall

2. Model-specific Observations:
   - Neural Network performance is substantially lower with new features (40.49%)
   - SVM shows better handling of Draw class in both feature sets

## Key Findings

1. Feature Impact:
   - New features provide marginally better overall accuracy
   - Lead to more balanced predictions across win categories
   - Haven't solved the fundamental challenge of Draw prediction

2. Model Selection:
   - Logistic Regression consistently performs well with both feature sets
   - CatBoost and Gradient Boosting models show robust performance
   - Tree-based models (Random Forest, Extra Trees) perform better with new features

## Recommendations

1. Feature Engineering:
   - Consider developing specific features for Draw prediction
   - Investigate feature importance for top-performing models
   - Explore feature combinations that improved HomeWin prediction balance

2. Model Development:
   - Focus on ensemble methods combining Logistic Regression and CatBoost
   - Consider separate models for Win/Loss vs Draw prediction
   - Investigate why Neural Network performance degraded with new features

3. Next Steps:
   - Analyze feature importance for both sets
   - Consider hybrid approach using different feature sets for different predictions
   - Experiment with feature selection techniques to optimize both sets
