   - Experiment with ensemble stacking

## Technical Insights

1. **ROC AUC Performance**
   - Most models achieve ROC AUC > 0.68 for both tasks
   - Consistent performance across different model types
   - Good indication of model discriminative ability

2. **Precision-Recall Trade-off**
   - Away Win: High precision, low recall
   - Home Win: More balanced precision-recall
   - Different optimization strategies needed for each task

3. **Model Complexity vs Performance**
   - Simpler models (Logistic Regression) competitive with complex ones
   - Ensemble methods consistently outperform single models
   - Diminishing returns from model complexity

This analysis suggests that the binary approach is more effective than multiclass prediction, with different models showing strengths for different aspects of the prediction task. The choice between Away Win and Home Win prediction models should be based on the specific requirements of the application and the relative importance of precision versus recall.
